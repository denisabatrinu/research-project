## 🔬🐟 Brief introduction
- The aim of this repository is to enhance reproducibility of my research by providing organized R code, data, and documentation for transparent data analysis.
- This research project was handed in on 22nd of April 2024 during my third year of my BSc in Biological Sciences at University of East Anglia.
- This research project seeks to understand the effect of heat stress on zebrafish embryos; see below for more information.


## 🎯 Objectives
-  Analyse one dataset contained within this repository (elegans_offspring.xlsx - used)
-  Use Markdown to write a formal lab report: hand the output in separately through Blackboard
-  Include all required scripts and Rmd files needed to fully reproduce your report here


## :round_pushpin:  Software specifications
This project was completed using R version 4.3.3 and RSTudio Desktop. Packages needed:
-  tidyverse **→** includes a range of essential packages (such as: ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr etc.)
-  readxl **→** reads the xlsx data file
-  performance **→** provides a collection of tools for visualizing models
-  ggpubr **→** facilitates ggplot2
-  GGally **→** reduces the complexity of combining geometric objects with transformed data
