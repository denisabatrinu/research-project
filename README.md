## âœ¨ Brief introduction
This is an additional source of information for module BIO 6019Y - Research Project. This assignment was handed in on 11th of May 2023 during my second year of my BSc in Biological Sciences at University of East Anglia. Skills acquired during the completion of this assignment include:  data cleaning, exploratory analysis, data visualization & statistical model building and inference.
This report studies the effect of the gene raga-1 and how it interacts with stress on longevity and reproduction in the nematode worm caenorhabditis elegans; see below for more information.


## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
-  Analyse one dataset contained within this repository (elegans_offspring.xlsx - used)
-  Use Markdown to write a formal lab report: hand the output in separately through Blackboard
-  Include all required scripts and Rmd files needed to fully reproduce your report here


## :round_pushpin:  Software specifications
This project was completed using R version 4.3.3 and RSTudio Desktop. Packages needed:
-  tidyverse **â†’** includes a range of essential packages (such as: ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr etc.)
-  readxl **â†’** reads the xlsx data file
-  performance **â†’** provides a collection of tools for visualizing models
-  ggpubr **â†’** facilitates ggplot2
-  GGally **â†’** reduces the complexity of combining geometric objects with transformed data
